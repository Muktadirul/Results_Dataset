================== ASTRAL ===================== 

This is ASTRAL version 5.5.12
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
15 trees read from dataset/11-texon/estimated_15genes_weakILS/sp_tree/Rep4_15genes
Scoring dataset/11-texon/estimated_15genes_weakILS/model/model_tree_trimmed
Scoring: 1 trees
Number of taxa: 11 (11 species)
Taxa: [2, 3, 4, 11, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 9, 1]
